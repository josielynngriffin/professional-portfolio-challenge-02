# Professional Portfolio Challenge-02
## Description
I created this portfolio page to give myself a place to display the future projects I create throughout the Coding Bootcamp. I tried to create a clean, easy-to-read layout that put focus on my personal information, my portfolio work, and my contact information for potential employers.

My motivations were to learn more about using CSS, creating responsive layouts, and to create a website with semantic HTML that met accessibility standards. I also tried to keep my code DRY and commented out my CSS so that I would understand it when looking back on it, seeing as it is best practice and that I will be coming back to this portfolio throughout my development journey. I learned a lot about flexbox to do complete this project, furthered my knowledge in semantic layouts, and added a bit of interaction on my links with psuedo classes.

I hope to refine this code as I add to this project!
